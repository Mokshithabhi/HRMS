Secure Route Protection â€” Only authenticated users can access the dashboard.

Employee Directory, Leave Requests, and Profile Page â€” All powered by mockapi.io dummy data.

Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean, modern, and fully responsive UI across devices.

State Management handled via React Context API for centralized and efficient data flow.

Custom Hooks implemented for cleaner, more maintainable, and reusable logic.

Reusable Components used to ensure consistent UI and better scalability.

Proxy Setup in vite.config.js for secure API calls and to avoid exposing backend endpoints in the client code.
